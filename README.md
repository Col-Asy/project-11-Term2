# Term 2 Project (20-20-20 rule)

Before starting with the introduction about the project, let's talk about why the project??
The 20-20-20 rule was designed by Californian optometrist Jeffrey Anshel as an easy reminder to take breaks and prevent eye strain, according to the Optometry Times. When following the rule, a person takes a 20-second break from looking at a screen every 20 minutes. Focusing on the same we decided to keep it 
steep and instead made a project to input the active and sleep time which will you know ahead following around the project. 

First step```$git clone https://github.com/Col-Asy/project-11-Term2.git```

Intalling the dependencies ```$pip install tkinter```

## Walkthrough around the project

+ As you see on initiating ```$python index.py``` the ```welcome``` window pops up. Seeing around it there 
are two options of choosing among two settings 

```Settings and Continue ahead```

+ As beginning with the **Settings** a new messagebox shows up to input the active and the sleep time.

+ The user can input the active time and the sleep time. Active time refers to the duration (minutes) in which the prompt window can come, whereas the sleep time (secs) refers to the delay where *break screen closes down and prompts again* following the loop.

+ Showing around the prompt window it consists of two options `Dismiss` which cancels the loop and the code ends. The another one `Skip break` to continue working without seeing the prompt window *(although the loop is still running)*.
